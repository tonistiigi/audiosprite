### What?

This is a `ffmpeg` wrapper that will take in **multiple audio files** and combine them **into a single file**. Silent gaps will be put between the parts so that every new part starts from full second and there is at least 1 second pause between every part. The final file will be exported in `mp3`, `ogg`, `ac3`, `m4a` and `caf`(IMA-ADPCM) to support as many devices as possible. This tool will also generate a `JSON` file that is compatible with [zynga/jukebox](https://github.com/zynga/jukebox) framework.

### Why?

iOS, Windows Phone and some Android phones have very limited HTML5 audio support. They only support playing single file at a time and loading in new files requires user interaction and has a big latency. To overcome this there is a technique to combine all audio into single file and only play/loop certain parts of that file. [zynga/jukebox](https://github.com/zynga/jukebox) is a audio framework that uses this technique.  [digitalfruit/limejs](https://github.com/digitalfruit/limejs) is a HTML5 game framework that includes Jukebox and lets you add audio to your games using audio sprites.

###Installation

npm install -g audiosprite

####Setting autoplay track

You can use `--autoplay` option to set a track that will start playing automatically. This track is then marked as autoplay and looping in the JSON. This syntax is Jukebox framework specific.

####Custom silent track

On some cases starting and pausing a file has bigger latency than just setting playhead position. You may get better results if your file is always playing. `--silence <duration>` option will generate extra track named *silence* that you can play instead of pausing the file.

####Usage with [zynga/jukebox](https://github.com/zynga/jukebox) framework.

Generated JSON file can be passed straight into `jukebox.Player` constructor. Check out Jukebox documentation/demos for more info.

```javascript
var settings = {/* JSON generated by audiosprite*/};
...
// This part needs to be in user event callback.
var myPlayer = new jukebox.Player(settings);
...
myPlayer.play('click');
```

####Usage with [digitalfruit/limejs](https://github.com/digitalfruit/limejs) framework.

First generate LimeJS asset from the JSON file that you can require inside your code.

```
> bin/lime.py gensoy path/to/mygameaudio.json
```

Then use `AudioMap` class to play the file.

```javascript
goog.require('lime.audio.AudioMap');
goog.require('lime.ASSETS.mygameaudio.json');

var audio = new lime.audio.AudioMap(lime.ASSETS.mygameaudio.json);
...
audio.play('click');
```
